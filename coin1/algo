example N=200 C=8
200 coins, 1 counterfeit, 8 chances to weigh
good weight == 10, bad weight == 1
therefore, bad half will be odd number
binary search?

            200

        100     100
       weigh  weigh(odd!)

              50      50
            weigh    weigh(odd!)

                   25      25
             weigh(odd!)   weigh
             12     13
          weigh(odd!)
        etc

base case? 
there is only one element in an array and its weight is odd
you have a 50/50 chance of picking the right index when at base case
